Page_15_SurveyPage_Question15_textarea,I was concerned why the scooter didn't have to stop at stop signs. I was concerned about going 9 mph. I was concerned that the scooter would just go right into an intersection without slowing down to see if pedestrians or cars were coming from the blind corners.  After all the negative reports about self driving Teslas; these experiments didn't make me feel better about the scooters either.
