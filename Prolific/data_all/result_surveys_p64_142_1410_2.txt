Page_15_SurveyPage_Question15_textarea,Very lame survey hosting. Too many loading required; and the surveys that interrupted in between the video disrupted the immersive experience of the video. The robotic voice of the scooter was also disrupting; there is no need to say what the scooter will do. It would be better if there were signal lights on a dashboard of the scooter.
