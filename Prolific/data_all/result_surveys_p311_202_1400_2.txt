Page_15_SurveyPage_Question15_textarea,The attention checks were overboard. Asking the commit to quality answers that late in the study was shady. The study length is confusing as Prolific says ten minutes; you say twenty minutes then you increase it to 20-30 minutes. The one part of the study says it will take 12 minutes; but was a lot faster than that.  You introduce cars and human pedestrians but then strangely never use them.  All in all it seemed like it would be a cool study initially; but honestly was not a very enjoyable experience. The survey questions were too monotonous especially asking if I was worried twice per break.   The delivery robot was yellow; but that isn't even an option on this page so I went orange.
