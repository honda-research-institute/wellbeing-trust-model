Page_15_SurveyPage_Question15_textarea,I just wanted to comment on the first section of the scooter interaction with the delivery robot. My answers for this section about the interaction with the delivery robot were based on the fact that the delivery robot kept going straight. Even though it did not move out of the way of the scooter; I figured that the delivery robot was just going to keep going straight; so I was happy with the interaction. I did not anticipate that the robot would move and was ready to break if I had to. The scooter moved out of the way automatically. However; as I said before; I was happy that the delivery robot did not make a sudden movement towards me as I moved; and just kept going straight. This made it easy to move out of the way of it.
